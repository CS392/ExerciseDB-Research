# How the application works
You can just run the application. It should just be an web 
application, depending on the browser or the IDE you created on
the web browser might not trust it. 

To test whether it work, there'll be a button for you to press
search, once that is done the HTML DOC should be populated with
information that you requested. It currently only fetches the most
recent ten, which might not be the best to showcases the full capability
of the API.

# Functionality
This is the research project portion for Exercise. It showscases
the API (through rapid API). It has an upper bound of 100 calls per
day, and it display the instructions of the specific exercise.
